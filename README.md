# Salary Trends Analysis

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that explores salary trends across various job titles in the tech industry, focusing on the impact of experience levels and remote work arrangements on compensation.

## Project Overview

In this project, we dive into a dataset of salary information to analyze how different factors—specifically work experience and the proportion of remote work—affect salary outcomes. The analysis zeroes in on trends over time and provides a detailed look at entry-level analyst positions, offering insights into the tech industry's current compensation practices.

## Key Findings

- Experience level significantly influences salary, with a clear upward trend in compensation as experience increases.
- Remote work arrangements have a nuanced impact on salaries, with fully remote positions offering competitive compensation compared to their on-site counterparts, especially among entry-level analyst roles.

## Dataset

The dataset includes salary data across multiple years, detailing job titles, experience levels, employment types, and remote work statuses among other factors. The data was sourced from [source name], a repository of tech industry salaries.
